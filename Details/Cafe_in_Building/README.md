The Cafe in the Building — FBI Redirected Police During Charlie Kirk Event | Distraction People #3

DESCRIPTION:
In this video, we examine Distraction Person #3 from the Charlie Kirk investigation. This one is unique — we don't have the person, but we have recorded police radio communications and some very interesting details.

Right when the Charlie Kirk event at UVU was unfolding, the FBI directed local law enforcement to redirect officers to a cafe at the University of Utah — 47 minutes north. An officer stated on the radio that the FBI told them there was an APB on someone at the Urban Pioneer cafe, specifically connected to the UVU shooting.

This is a classic "white rabbit" pattern. Intelligence services have used decoy rabbits for over a hundred years to pull police attention and resources away from what's really happening. You get law enforcement focused on a shiny object at a distant location while the real action unfolds elsewhere.

KEY QUESTIONS:
- Was there actually an APB, or was it fabricated?
- Which FBI person gave the order?
- Did they have legitimate reasons to issue it?
- Who authorized it above them?

IMPORTANT: This is not saying anyone at the cafe did anything illegal or immoral. The person there may have been an unwitting pawn — researched, positioned, and then used as bait to tie up police resources. The real investigation trail leads UP the chain of command: who gave the order, who authorized it, and why.

NEXT STEPS FOR INVESTIGATORS:
- File FOIA requests for the APB documentation
- File GRAMA requests for the police radio logs
- Identify the FBI person who issued the directive
- Trace the chain of command above them
- If requests are blocked, that itself is significant

This is about the Charlie Kirk investigation. This happened exactly when the event occurred, or within an hour afterwards. The point about this is that intelligence services use a distraction rabbit. It may not be any real criminal, but the goal is to pull police away and distract them. This is to show that police were sent here. They were apparently sent here by the FBI. It was probably a waste of their time, but seeing the details in this video is important because of the specifics that you'll see in the video.

With the Charlie Kirk investigation, we will go through seven distraction people, and this will be interesting in terms of what's going on and what makes each one unique. None of this is saying that these people did anything illegal or immoral. It's just a matter of there being some interesting aspects worth looking at, and we'll go through all seven. The fact that there are seven is interesting in itself.

When there's an intelligence service operation, one really big sign that jumps out is if there's a white rabbit or two. A white rabbit is a distraction. They often call them a decoy rabbit. The idea is that when things are going down and it's very real-time intense, you get people focused on this distraction, this shiny object, so that the actual people involved can get away. If those people end up acting somewhat different than the normal crowd, they can end up not being noticed. Cameras will not be pointing at them; they'll be pointing at the shiny object. There's a long history of this, many decades, even a hundred years of it. There are books by intelligence services with a long list of references, and they talk about how these decoy rabbits are important. There are some references here, and for the sake of keeping this video short, I'll go quickly. It's often worth coming back and going through the slides to read all the content I put in them.

Over here are historic examples of these white rabbits, and we'll go into the details of who they are.

Now, moving on to number three. This one, we don't have the person, but we have some pretty interesting things. What this is about is a certain building at a different university, the University of Utah. It's not that far away, and there's a linkage to the UVU Charlie Kirk event. Right when the event happened, police were about to move in. For a white rabbit operation, you want to pull them away, and you can often do that in interesting ways.

In this case, we have recorded police radio between two local law enforcement officers. One of them was telling the other to grab one person, maybe a few, and redirect over to this university, this building. Inside is a certain urban cafe, Pioneer Cafe. I think it's been renamed to Urban Pioneer Food. They were told to go there, that there's an APB out for someone, and to go get them. They said it's specifically for the shooting at UVU, as if somebody had moved afterwards over to this location.

My guess is it's not whoever the real shooter was. My guess is it might well fit a pattern we're trying to identify. Instead of the person the police go to talk to necessarily knowing about the event or being in on it, it's just somebody, and then they're lining it up so that someone pulls the lever to tell police to go swarm that person, basically tying up the police.

What we really want to find out is who told the police. In this case, it was the FBI. The officer even stated on the radio that so-and-so from the FBI, from whatever office they mentioned, told them there is an APB on this person, now located at the Urban Pioneer. The FBI is literally telling the local law enforcement to grab a chunk of their officers and move them over to spend time on this. It's far enough away that it can tie them up for a while.

So we need to go figure this out. Here are the quotes from some of the radio communications. Here's the distance: it's 47 minutes up north. Maybe there was nobody there, maybe there was somebody there. But we effectively need to go through the documents. Is there an APB, or was there not? Was there actually no APB? Who was the FBI person that said that? Did they actually have legitimate reasons to say that, or not?

Here's the to-do list. If we go through this step by step and pull this information out, then we either find out the FBI was lying or that it's true. Is there a real person? Who was it and what were they doing? Or if it's a lie, which FBI person is lying? Then you pull up the management chain above them to see who's involved. Then be alarmed if the FOIA requests and the GRAMA requests are blocked.

You can come back and go slower. I'll go fast for speed here. Here is a map of places and various things that we created, and that was really great work.

I'll come back to this point: when an intelligence service operation happens at some scale, white rabbits will often appear. If your job is to hunt down the management above that white rabbit, then you want to use this kind of process. Those are important things to look at.

Now, all the people I talked about, let's say none of them knew anything beforehand. None of them did anything immoral or illegal. A lot of it could end up being that they research somebody who doesn't know, then line it up so that person is at the right place at the right time, and then they send the police there to tie up the police. That person, the unwitting victim, has no idea about it. They kind of become a white rabbit unknowingly. But the thing we want to trace back to is: who told the law enforcement to go after them? What was their excuse? Did it turn out to be bald-faced lies? We basically want to go up the management chain. Who did that law enforcement FBI person work with? Who would they get authorized by? Who were they communicating with? Walk up the chain. Follow the chain.

I'm tracking censorship on X and other places. The main thing is, if you report on anything lining up to intelligence services, they go hard at you on this issue to limit your impact. So please use the repost button. My videos never get anywhere because I'm so censored on this stuff. That's the only way it ever gets anywhere.

If you find this to be valuable, over here I have a list of videos. They're like this one and go super in depth on exactly this Charlie Kirk September event. They're on my YouTube. You probably will never see them unless you go there directly. Those videos go in depth on effectively how we can help get these hard facts that the investigators are documenting included, and then use them as mechanisms to latch onto the trail of any intelligence service hiding in the shadows and drag them out, without their permission, into the public.

With my software engineering background, I'm coming up with a number of things I'll be launching to make it where citizens can end up having power to get to the truth. Thomas Massie passed a law against a bad actor from the island, and that law is forcing out files. But here are other things that we as citizens can pursue to have power.

One is AI Attorney, an open source project, free. I've been using it. I built it internally and I'll be releasing it over time. I use it to chase down research, especially legal research, and it's been very powerful.

The second one is preventing censorship. I'm finding people across the Charlie Kirk investigation side on X are having the same quieting problem. If people look at anything beyond the narrative that's allowed, their account gets locked. They basically don't appear on anyone's feed at all, or are very limited. It's a big issue, and that's why the repost is super critical.

Then there's a movie I'll be working on, and there will be other things to help us pull out what's going on behind the scenes.

My other videos are shown here. Here's the first video. Here's the second video, and there's a ton in those videos. It's kind of like this one where I cover a lot. Here's a third video with a lot in it. Definitely go over to the account. My email address is here, and you can contact me because it's important. Follow me if you want to. That's what we covered in presenting to you today. Have a wonderful day.
