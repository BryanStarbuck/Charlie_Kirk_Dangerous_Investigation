In this video, we examine Distraction Person #2 from the Charlie Kirk investigation — the Pellet Gun Guy. This one has some uniquely interesting details that nobody else has covered.
Critical to See:

* My name is Bryan Starbuck
* I (Bryan Starbuck) am calling on Thomas Massie to create a CHARLIE KIRK FILES DISCLOSURE, which I wrote up here:
* https://github.com/BryanStarbuck/Charlie_Kirk_175_Critical_To_Expose
* https://github.com/BryanStarbuck/Bryan_Starbuck_Lawfare
* https://github.com/BryanStarbuck/Charlie_Kirk_Dangerous_Investigation
* I am having to release a LONG list of my investigation today on my X and YouTube account, that hasn't be released before.

This individual was arrested about 11 minutes north of UVU, where the Charlie Kirk event took place. He was carrying an airsoft or pellet gun — not a rifle. But here is the detail that jumps out: someone put a silencer on it. You do not need a silencer on an air gun. They are already quiet. There is no explosion, no gunpowder. The silencer serves no functional purpose — except to look scary and grab maximum attention. That is exactly what a "white rabbit" decoy is designed to do.

I was able to hunt down the exact location of the arrest in Provo — in front of Joe Vera's restaurant — by matching second-floor windows, camera angles, and nearby landmarks. Nobody had posted this location anywhere online. Having the precise address enables targeted FOIA requests to trace the chain of events.

KEY QUESTIONS:

- What is his name?
- Who provided the pellet gun with the silencer?
- Who reported him to police?
- Was anyone communicating with him before the event?
- Why are the arrest records scrubbed or inaccessible?
IMPORTANT: This is not saying this person did anything illegal or immoral. He may have been an unwitting pawn — researched, positioned, and then used as bait to tie up police resources at a critical moment. The real investigation trail leads UP the chain of command: who set it up, who authorized it, and why.

NEXT STEPS FOR INVESTIGATORS:

- File FOIA requests for arrest records and incident reports
- Identify the individual through police records
- Trace the origin of the weapon and the silencer
- Determine who made the report to police
- Examine whether anyone recruited or directed him
- If requests are blocked, that itself is significant
