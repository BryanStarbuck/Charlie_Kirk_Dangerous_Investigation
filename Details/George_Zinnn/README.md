In intelligence operations, "white rabbits" (decoy rabbits) are used to distract attention at critical moments. George Zinn fits this pattern in the Charlie Kirk investigation.

Key points:
- White rabbits draw cameras and law enforcement to a shiny object while the real action happens elsewhere
- This tactic has over 100 years of documented use by intelligence services
- Zinn's behavior tied up local law enforcement at the critical moment, pulling them away from where they should have been
- He has a prior record: received probation for a jailable offense at the Salt Lake City marathon via plea deal
- Google searches for his full name, including middle name, appeared approximately 30 days before the event from the other side of the planet
- Planning clusters align: early prep in November-December 2023, peak planning in June-August, intense September final phase

The real question isn't whether Zinn knew anything. People can be used as unwitting decoys, researched and positioned at the right place and time, then police get sent after them to tie up law enforcement resources.

What matters: Who told law enforcement to go after him? What was their excuse? Follow the chain up. Who authorized it? Who were they communicating with?

Repost if you find this valuable. Censorship on this topic is aggressive. Full deep-dive videos on YouTube covering the Charlie Kirk September event in detail.
