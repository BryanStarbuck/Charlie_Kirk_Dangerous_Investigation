# Charlie_Kirk_Dangerous_Investigation

My name is Bryan Starbuck. 

The following are what I think are critical parts of the Charlie Kirk investigation to be made public.


My name is Bryan Starbuck.  I ask Thomas Massie, who created the Epstein Files Forced Disclosure law... to create a parallel law "Charlie Kirk FILES Forced Disclosure Law".

I think my life is at risk. Either to be setup to go to the grave early, or legally setup. I will not commit suicide. I also worry I will be taken-out, in the legal system. ([Here is why I worry](https://github.com/BryanStarbuck/Bryan_Starbuck_Lawfare))
